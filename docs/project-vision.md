**Project Name:** Job-Matching App (Informal Sector Workers)  
**Prepared By:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Introduction
The informal sector in Kenya and many developing countries employs a large percentage of the population. Despite their skills, many workers (technicians, artisans, casual laborers, and ground workers) face challenges in finding consistent work due to lack of visibility and limited access to digital platforms.

This project aims to create a **web-based job-matching app (MERN stack)** that connects these workers with employers, bridging the gap between opportunity and skills.

---

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a **minimum viable product (MVP)** that demonstrates the core concept:
- Workers can **register profiles** highlighting their skills, location, and contact details.  
- Employers can **post jobs** and search for workers.  
- A simple **application system** allows workers to apply and employers to accept or reject applications.  

While it begins as a **study project with minimal financial investment**, the long-term vision is to evolve it into a viable business platform.

## 3. Goals & Objectives
- âœ… Build an MVP using the **MERN stack**.  
- âœ… Provide **accessible job search tools** for informal workers.  
- âœ… Enable **employers to quickly find and hire skilled workers**.  
- âœ… Lay the foundation for **monetization and scalability**.

## 4. Scope
### In Scope (MVP)
- Worker registration and profile creation.  
- Employer job posting and management.  
- Basic search & filtering of jobs.  
- Job application workflow.  
- Secure authentication (JWT).  

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- AI-based skill-job matching.  
- SMS/USSD support for offline workers.  
- Ratings & reviews system.  
- M-Pesa integration for payments.  
- Multi-language support.  

---

## 5. Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Informal sector workers & employers.  
- **Developer**: Solo developer (student) responsible for design, coding, testing, and deployment.  
- **Future Business Stakeholders**: NGOs, government agencies, training institutions,local businesses, and microfinance institutions.  

---

## 6. Constraints
- **Budget**: Zero/very limited budget (using free tiers of hosting and databases).  
- **Resources**: Solo project; limited development time.  
- **Technology**: Open-source tools (MERN stack, Netlify/Vercel, Render, MongoDB Atlas free tier).  

---

## 7. Assumptions
- Users have basic smartphone/internet access.  
- Informal workers are open to registering digitally if the process is simple.  
- Employers are willing to use a web platform to find workers.  

---

## 8. Monetization Strategy 
1. **Freemium Model** â€“ Workers can list profiles for free; premium workers may pay for boosted visibility.  
2. **Employer Charges** â€“ Employers post basic jobs for free, but pay a fee for featured listings.  
3. **Transaction Fees** â€“ In future, take a small commission per successful match or payment through M-Pesa.  
4. **Partnerships** â€“ Collaborate with NGOs, government job programs, training institutions, or local businesses.  

---

## 9. Risks
- **Adoption risk**: Workers may prefer traditional methods (word of mouth).  
- **Technology barrier**: Some users may struggle with digital platforms.  
- **Financial sustainability**: Without funding, scaling may be slow.  

---

## 10. Success Criteria
- Working MVP deployed online.  
- At least 20â€“50 test users (workers/employers).  
- User feedback collected and documented.  
- Clear roadmap toward monetization and scaling.  

---

## 11. Future Vision
In the long term, the app aims to become **the go-to platform for informal job opportunities in Kenya and East Africa**. With AI-driven skill matching, offline access (USSD/SMS), and integrated payments, it could evolve into a **sustainable social enterprise** that uplifts workers while generating revenue.
