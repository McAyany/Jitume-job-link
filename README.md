# Job Matching App (Informal Sector)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Job Matching App is a web platform designed to help **informal sector workers** (technicians, artisans, laborers, etc.) connect with job opportunities.  
It bridges the gap between workers and potential employers in Kenya and beyond, functioning like a "freelancer marketplace" tailored for the informal sector.

## ðŸ”¹ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Planning & Requirements
- Define target users: job seekers, employers, admin.
- Gather functional requirements (profiles, job posting, job search, AI matching).
- Define non-functional requirements (scalability, security, mobile-friendly).

### 2. System Design
- **Tech Stack (MERN):**
  - MongoDB â€“ Database
  - Express.js â€“ Backend framework
  - React â€“ Frontend framework
  - Node.js â€“ Server environment
- **Database Schema (ERD sketch):**
  ```
  User {
    user_id (PK)
    name
    role (worker/employer)
    skills[]
    location
    contact_info
  }

  Job {
    job_id (PK)
    title
    description
    location
    employer_id (FK)
    status (open/closed)
  }

  Application {
    application_id (PK)
    job_id (FK)
    worker_id (FK)
    status (pending/accepted/rejected)
  }
  ```
- **APIs planned:**
  - Auth (login/register)
  - Job CRUD (create, list, apply)
  - User profiles (create, update, search)
  - AI skill-matching (future enhancement)

### 3. Implementation
- **Backend (Express + MongoDB + Mongoose)**
- **Frontend (React + Axios + Tailwind CSS)**
- **Authentication (JWT)**
- **Testing tools:** Postman, Jest

### 4. Testing
- Unit testing for backend APIs
- Integration testing (React + Express)
- End-to-end testing (manual + automated)

### 5. Deployment
- Backend: Render / Heroku / AWS
- Frontend: Netlify / Vercel
- DB: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
- Environment variables for security

### 6. Maintenance
- Continuous improvements
- Bug fixing
- Add AI-powered recommendations
